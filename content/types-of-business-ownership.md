# Sole proprietorship

## Pros
* This is the easiest business entity to set up.
* The owner is completely in control of the business.

## Cons
* The owner takes all the risks and is liable in his private capacity, meaning that the owner is responsible for any
business debt.
* It is not possible to take on any partners. You must dissolve the business and start a different entity.

# Partnership

## Pros
* Partners can share the financial burden of a new business. 

## Cons
* You cannot make business decisions on your own. 
* All partners are responsible for business debt, doesn't matter who created it.


# Private company


# Franchise
